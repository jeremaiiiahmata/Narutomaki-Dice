# Narutomaki-Dice
The website simulates rolling dice for player one and player two, instead of dice, its the amount of narutomaki in a bowl of ramen. The results are stored in variables, and the dice images are then updated to match the rolled numbers. Once both players have rolled, the winner is determined and their name is returned.
